Searching the web is becoming more and more unpleasant.

_I want the result, not YouTube clickbait_

Using Google is a necessary pain I have to endure every day: ads, clickbait, poor quality results, etc.

I have already tested alternatives like DDG, Bing, etc., but none of them gave me full satisfaction.

In late 2024, I encountered a lot of posts and comments about Kagi on [Hacker News](https://www.notion.so/cyprieng/link). This caught my attention.

In early 2025, almost 6 months ago, I decided to give it a try.

Here is a small wrap-up of how I feel about it.

# Paying for a search engine

First thing, that almost stopped me. And I think it's one of the main reasons that would block most users.

You need to pay to use Kagi.

If you ignore the $5/month plan, which is far too limited, the cheapest is $10/month + tax.

That's a steep amount to pay every month for a search engine when all the competitors provide it for free. But I search a lot:

With around 1,500 searches/month, a search would cost me $0.0067. Clearly, that puts it in perspective, and if it improves my day-to-day, it may be worth it.

And the fact that the search engine is funded by its users and not by ads is, for me, an important point.

In the end, I decided to give it a try.

# Search

The search seems good—very good.

_Straightforward results—no nonsense, nothing fancy, just what I want._

To be honest, I didn’t do a lot of side-by-side comparisons against other search engines.

But in the last 5 months, I feel the quality of my searches has improved compared to Google.

It’s really hard to tell why, but the search results seem more accurate and less “hostile” than the ones from Google. You manage to get what you want with less friction.

Other advantages are the following features:

## No Ads

You don't have ads. NEVER.

That might not sound like much, but the experience is a breeze when you are used to Google pushing ads everywhere with very poor quality.

## Lens

This is probably my most used feature.

It allows you to search only on a configurable subset of websites.

I mostly use this to search on Y Combinator and Reddit.

## URL redirect

Speaking of Reddit, I hate the new one. So, for example, you can redirect all links to the old one.

You can use a Chrome extension for this, but with Kagi it works everywhere—even on iOS Safari.

## Boost & Bury

Pinterest and similar sites are a plague for search engines. Kagi allows you to block such sites.

It also allows you to decrease or increase relevancy depending on your needs.

## Privacy

I trust a company that is not living off ads more. But even if you do not trust them, they provide <https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-privacy-pass> to ensure they cannot track you.

# AI

We live in a world where every product includes AI features—for better, and more often, for worse.

But Kagi provides pretty good features based on AI:

## Quick response

As soon as you include “?” at the end of the query on Kagi, it will provide a summary of the results at the top.

Very handy to save time and avoid checking a few websites when you only need a quick answer.

## Summarise

You have a long article, podcast, or video you don’t have time to read. Kagi Summarise allows you to get a short summary.

I mainly use it to check if the content is worth reading or not.

## Assistant

This is one of the main features of Kagi, and the reason I chose the Ultimate plan.

The Assistant allows you to chat with all the mainstream LLMs:

It allows me to switch between Claude, ChatGPT, etc., without subscribing to each one or getting several API keys.

And new models are usually available in less than 48h, so you can test all models as soon as they are available.

Previously, the usage was unlimited, but now it’s limited to $25 usage, so the value of the Ultimate plan has decreased a bit.

# Orion browser

I won’t describe this much. But for the short span of time when I tried it on my Mac, I really liked:

- the native look and feel
- the ability to install Chrome extensions
- the handling of window/tab groups
- the ability to have tabs vertically on the left

Sadly, I encountered too many bugs and decided to give up for now. But I will definitely check it again when it comes out of beta in November (<https://blog.kagi.com/first-three-years>).

# Conclusion

The price is pretty steep for a search engine. But I definitely encourage everybody to test it for a month to see if you find it valuable or not.

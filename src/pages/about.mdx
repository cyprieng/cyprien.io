## Hi, I'm Cyprien Guillemot 👋

I'm a senior software engineer working and living in Montpellier, France 🇫🇷.

I've been passionate about tech and software development from a young age.
When I was around 10, I remember tinkering with Microsoft Access to build basic apps on a computer that looked like this:

I'm primarily interested in backend development, but I like every part of the stack, from front development to infrastructure.

Here's a list of technologies I frequently use:

- ![TypeScript logo](assets/icons/typescript.svg) Javascript / Typescript
- ![React logo](assets/icons/react.svg) React
- ![Vue.js logo](assets/icons/vuejs.svg) Vuejs
- ![Python logo](assets/icons/python.svg) Python
- ![Ruby logo](assets/icons/ruby.svg) Ruby
- ![PHP logo](assets/icons/php.svg) PHP
- ![Go logo](assets/icons/gopher.svg) Go
- ![Swift logo](assets/icons/swift.svg) Swift
- ![PostgreSQL logo](assets/icons/postgresql.svg) Postgres
- ![ClickHouse logo](assets/icons/clickhouse.svg) Clickhouse
- ![MongoDB logo](assets/icons/mongodb.svg) MongoDB
- ![Kubernetes logo](assets/icons/kubernetes.svg) Kubernetes
- ![Azure logo](assets/icons/azure.svg) Azure
- ![AWS logo](assets/icons/aws.svg) AWS

I love [Open Source](https://github.com/cyprieng), I'm always working on [projects](/projects/) on the side of my day job.

Outside of tech, here are my other passions:

- 🏃‍♂️ Running: from 10km to marathon
- 🥾 Hiking and especially the bivouac in the middle of nowhere
- 📚 Reading fiction and non-fiction books

I'm also really interested in all topics around sports, health and productivity.

Globally, I really love to learn in pretty much any domain.

## Music

Here are my top artists directly pulled from my Last.fm account.
As you can see, it's mainly metal 🤘.

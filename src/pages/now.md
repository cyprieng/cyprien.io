Based on the brilliant idea of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/), here is what I'm doing now.

_Updated August 28th, 2025_

- Built a new completely useless small project: [github-breakout](/projects/github-breakout/).
- Falling back in love with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and migrating all my notes to it.
- Built a small Obsidian [plugin](https://github.com/cyprieng/obsidian-github-publisher) to simplify the publication of some of my notes.
- Exploring Stoic philosophy.
- 🚴🏃‍♂️ Training for triathlon.
- 🏊 Taking classes to learn how to swim front crawl properly.

This is a yearly review of 2024. This list is probably useless for everyone but me, but it forces me to write things down.

## 2024 Non-tech achievements

- Finally followed a real running training plan with [Campus Coach](https://www.campus.coach/) after years of improvised training
- Same for weight training with [Tactical Barbell](https://www.tacticalbarbell.com/)
- First year of non-stop running and bike commuting even when temperatures exceeded 35°C
- Continued to improve my nutrition which is already far above 90% of the population
- Continued to improve my health by learning more and more through podcasts and books
- Started meditating 10 min every day with [Petit Bambou](https://www.petitbambou.com/fr)

- Improved my organization with Apple Reminders and Notion
- I finally succeeded in reading every night for at least 20 min (my favorite book this year is The Three-Body Problem trilogy, completely in love with the universe)

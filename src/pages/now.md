Based on the brilliant idea of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/), here is what I'm doing now.

_Updated February 9th, 2025_

- Finished building my first real project in years: [Wenigwarden](https://www.cyprien.io/projects/wenigwarden/). The main goal was to learn the basics of SwiftUI.
- Learning more deeply how to build LLMs.
- Switched from a TKL keyboard and a Logitech vertical mouse, to an hotdox and a Kensington trackball: [see on my uses page](https://www.cyprien.io/uses/). The switch is pretty rough but very promising.

And on a more personal note:

- üèÉ Training for the 2025 Barcelona Marathon (D-35).

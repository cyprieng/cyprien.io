Based on the brilliant idea of [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/), here is what I'm doing now.

_Updated March 22, 2025_

- Finished building my first real project in years: [Wenigwarden](https://www.cyprien.io/projects/wenigwarden/). The main goal was to learn the basics of SwiftUI.
- Teaching myself machine learning.
- Switched from a TKL keyboard and a Logitech vertical mouse to an HotDox and a Kensington trackball: [see on my uses page](https://www.cyprien.io/uses/). The switch is pretty rough but very promising.
- Successfully ran the 2025 Barcelona Marathon in 3h32.

And on a more personal note:

- üèä Learning how to swim crawl properly.
- üö¥ Getting back to cycling after a long break due to the marathon training.

Working in VR headset have been a thing for some times now.

I have first head of it arround 2017 with <https://www.vrdesktop.net/>.

The appeal is clear. You can have some giant screen available wherever you go taking almost no physical space.

But for me, to be honest, the idea of sticking a VR headset to your face during hours to work seems like a terrible idea.

But in early 2024 Apple start selling the Vision pro, and with it, a new wave of people using it to work.

And after seeing too many people using VR headset to work I decided to give it a try.

After some research, the most popular and cost-friendly option in late 2024 is to use a Meta Quest 3 with <https://immersed.com/>.

So a few minutes later I ordered my headset on Amazon and the next day here it is.

To put some context, I never used a proper VR headset in my life, so some very basic stuff may have impressed me more than the average VR user.

After switching it on, the tutorial start, and I have to admit, seeing those interfaces floating arround me looks like some SF movies.

_Even this simple menu impressed me_

I then installed Immersed and setup 3 screens with my macbook. I use the usb conneciton to ensure the smallest latency (FYI not all USB cable are compatible but the OEM cable from an iphone 16 pro works).

The result is pretty impressived, you have giant screen floating in front of you, the quality is decent, the passthrought is pretty good.

_3 giant screens in front of you is pretty impressive the first time_

You can use your hand to move the screens wherever you want.

The main issue at first is the comfort of the original strap. I bought a Kiwi strap to replace to awful original.

I have tried a lot of task in a few days: watching TV, coding, browsing web, etc…

_Watching TV/movies is probably the best usage I found_

Overrrall everything works, i never had a connection issue and not even a lag. Immersed is definitvely a really nice sowftware.

I only used the mixed reality settings, virtual environement make me sick and remind me of old PS1 games.

My conclusion after a few days is that the technology is very impressive but there are too many drawbacks to really make it a viable option:

- screen quality: even if it’s impressive at first, the quality is not as good as even a low end monitor. You can clearly see every pixel and when you move your head you see some artefacts and checkerboard effect.
- passtrought: it is decent, but the quality reminds me the camera of very old phone. And in dark room it is even worse. You dont’t really look at the environement, so it’s not a dealbreaker, but still a weakness.
- confort: after arround 20min I start having headache. This is very personal, some people are very confortable using VR headset during hours, I’m not. I cannot imagine working my 8 hours with this.
- isolation: I find it very isolating, and as I am arelady far too isolated when I work on my laptop, I really don’t want to worsen this.
- Social accpetation: I may be a bit too concerned about what i look like, but I really can’t imagine using it in public.

Moreover I have a desk with 3 big screens and I cannot see how any headset could be more comfortable. And for the few time I work on the go, even my 13inch screen does the job.

For me the biggest advantage of this setup is the ability to carry a giant screen with you everywhere. For people travelling a lot, and not subject to headache in VR, I would definitively recomment to give it a try.

But if you are not travelling a lot, or do not need more than your laptop screen when on the go, I don’t find any reason to try the VR setup.

I sent my headset back to Amazon for a refund. But event if the experience is not that good, I hightly encourage you to try it yourself, I find it very impressive and worth a few hours of my time.

I don’t know if the Apple vision pro and its successor will push this tech to become more mature. But even in this case, the isolation provided by this kind of devide and the lack of social acceptance may remain major dealbreakers for most people. But for tech enthousiast this may become a popular option.
